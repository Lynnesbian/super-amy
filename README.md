This game is **still in early alpha**, so don't expect much from it in the way of playability just yet.

## Cloning this repository
Install git, and use this command:
`git clone --recursive -j4 https://github.com/deleeciousCheeps/super-amy`
Don't forget the `--recursive`! Otherwise, the game will fail to run.

## Necessary software
To run this game, you'll need [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) version 11.1. Versions below 11 won't work, and later versions might introduce breaking changes.

To edit the provided files, you'll need the following:
 - [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) v2.10 or later for the .xcf files in `res/img`
 - [DefleMask](http://www.deflemask.com/) for the .dmf files in `res/mus/deflemask`

All of this software is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, free of charge.

## Running the game
After installing LÖVE, there are two ways to run the game.
 - Compress the entire directory as a zip and rename it to "super-amy.love", then run `love super-amy.love`
